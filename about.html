		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm a software engineer and student living in Boston. I have experience as a backend and full stack web developer, as well as with robotics. Sometimes I have fun in my free time. Don't take this as a résumé. If that's what you're looking for, <a href="resources/resume.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<h3>Backend Web Development</h3>
		<p>I've worked extensively on backend services in both Java and Django, developing REST APIs and creating microservices. In doing so I've leveraged frameworks like Dropwizard, Kafka, Flask, and the Django REST Framework. I've also used C#, C/C++, and Racket to a lesser extent.</p>
		<h3>Frontend Web Development</h3>
		<p>Sometimes I'm a full stack developer, so I know HTML/CSS/JS, and I've used React a fair bit. I don't know enough to be a frontend dev, but I'm competent enough to work on an existing codebase.</p>
		<h3>Databases</h3>
		<p>I've used a few different ways to put data in boxes. I have experience with mySQL, Redis, and HBase. Once I used an Excel spreadsheet to store some data, but I don't like to talk about it.</p>
		<h3>DevOps</h3>
		<p>Admittedly not my strong suit, but I know enough to get things done. I have plenty of experience in the terminal and can write shell scripts when I need to. I've used AWS, Docker, Elasticsearch, Jenkins, and more.</p>
		<h3>Soft Skills</h3>
		<p>I can talk to people. I can work in a team. I can run meetings. I can give presentations, though I prefer not to. I can write emails and meeting notes and Slack messages that are worth reading. If I commit to something, I try my best to meet that commitment, and I know when to ask for help if I'm running into trouble.</p>
		<h3>Other Things</h3>
		<p>I'm familiar with Agile related topics: version control, continuous deployment, working in small teams. I know my way around Linux, Windows, and OSX. I know a bit about graphic design, 3D modeling, and photography. I've worked on robots and drones, and I can build you a basic circuit and control it with an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. I can do other stuff too.</p>
		<h2>School</h2>
		<p>I'm currently a senior at Northeastern University in Boston pursuing a dual major in computer engineering and computer science. I'm also a member of Northeastern's chapters of IEEE and Eta Kappa Nu, the honors program, and the University Scholars Program, awarded to the top 1% of applicants.</p>
		<p>Between my engineering and computer science coursework I've learned about everything from computer architecture to artificial intelligence, with experience in both hardware and software. I've also taken elective classes in math, music, linguistics, and other topics that interest me.</p>
		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>I've completed 3 co-op work experiences during my time at Northeastern. First, I worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.qinetiq-na.com/" target="_blank">QinetiQ North America</a> building hazmat detection robots. Next, I was a full stack web developer at <a href="https://www.bitsighttech.com/" target="_blank">BitSight Technologies</a> creating cybersecurity reports. Most recently, I worked at <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank">HubSpot</a> as a backend engineer where I helped bring the Conversations live chat tool from prototype to release.</p>
		<h2>Fun</h2>
		<p>My hobbies include cooking, photography, gaming (video, board, and tabletop games), and game design. I've dabbled in everything from graphic design to indoor gardening, and I'm always looking for new projects.</p>
		<h2>Volunteering</h2>
		<p>I do STEM outreach volunteer work with Northeastern's <a href="https://stem.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for STEM Education</a>, the <a href="https://www.cambridgesciencefestival.org/" target="_blank">Cambridge Science Festival</a>, and the Roxbury Robotics student organization.</p>
