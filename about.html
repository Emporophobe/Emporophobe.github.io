		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h2>School</h2>
		<p>
		I'm currently a senior at Northeastern University in Boston pursuing a dual major in computer engineering and computer science. I'm also a member of Northeastern's chapters of IEEE and Eta Kappa Nu. I do STEM outreach volunteer work with Northeastern's <a href="https://stem.neu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for STEM Education</a>, the <a href="https://www.cambridgesciencefestival.org/" target="_blank">Cambridge Science Festival</a>, and the Roxbury Robotics student organization.
		</p>
		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>
		I've completed 3 co-op work experiences during my time at Northeastern. First, I worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.qinetiq-na.com/" target="_blank">QinetiQ North America</a> building hazmat detection robots. Next, I was a full stack web developer at <a href="https://www.bitsighttech.com/" target="_blank">BitSight Technologies</a> creating cybersecurity reports. Most recently, I worked at <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank">HubSpot</a> as a backend engineer where I helped bring the Conversations live chat tool from prototype to release.
		</p>
		<h2>Fun</h2>
		<p>
		My hobbies include cooking, photography, gaming (video, board, and tabletop games), and game design. I've dabbled in everything from graphic design to indoor gardening, and I'm always looking for new projects.
