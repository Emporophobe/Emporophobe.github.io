		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>Below are a few personal projects I've worked on, at hackathons, game jams, and on my own. Most are code-based, but I've also done some game design and other projects.</p>

		<h3>C#, Unity, Photoshop</h3>
		<p>The theme of the 2018 Global Game Jam was "Transmission", so naturally my team made a game where you recruit people to join your cult by wooing them on a dating app. Really. For the full experience, watch the trailer we made.</p>

		<h3>Java, JavaFx, MVC, OOP</h3>
		<p>This project was an experiment to see how object oriented I could reasonably make a basic project. At first it was a basic Pong clone, but then I abstracted away as much as I could. There's a fairly large set of properties you can configure: everything from the number of players to the size of the game to the number of balls. You can also add some blocks in the middle to turn the game into Breakout. The project follows the MCV framework, with interfaces, inheritence, and abstractions aplenty. Is it practical? No. Was it interesting? Yes.</p>

		<h2 id="fun">Fun Things Generator</h2>
		<h3>Java, Swing, REST</h3>
		<p>For Northeastern's second HuskyHacks hackathon, some friends and I decided to solve the problem where we wanted to do something fun but couldn't decide on what to do. Naturally, we looked to the internet to solve our woes. This project is essentially a frontend for several APIs to search for restaurants, movies, games, and other entertainment. You input things like how many people there are and how much money you want to spend, and get back a randomly-selected activity guaranteed to entertain you.</p>

		<h2 id="markov">Fun With Markov Chains</h2>
		<h3>Python</h3>
		<p>I've done a couple projects over the years using Markov chains to generate text. One was the first real software project I ever did, a Twitter bot that would generate mock-Shakespearean prose. The code is pretty terrible, but the results are pretty funny. Later, when I knew a bit more about what I was doing, I wrote a word generator which draws on a list of words you give it to generate similar words. I've used it to create names and locations for D&amp;D and such.</p>

		<h2 id="site">MichaelWong.io</h2>
		<h3>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
		<p>I made the website you're looking at right now. It's hosted on GitHub Pages, so it's 100% frontend, and written from scratch in pure HTML/CSS/JS. If anything seems overengineered (does a site this small really need a nav banner?), it's because I'm also using this site to learn about frontend technology.</p>
